# 🔒 Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 5, 2025

## Our Commitment

Fertile was built with one core principle: **your fertility data belongs to you and only you**. We believe sensitive health information should never leave your device without your explicit action.

---

## ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer

**Fertile is NOT medical advice.**

This application provides fertility predictions based on calendar methods only. These are **estimates** and should NOT be relied upon as:

- A primary method of contraception
- A guaranteed method for conception timing
- A substitute for professional medical advice

**Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider** for any fertility-related decisions, concerns, or medical conditions.

## 🏠 Local-Only Storage

### How Your Data is Stored

All data in Fertile is stored locally on your device using **IndexedDB**, a browser-based database:

- ✅ **No cloud storage** — Data never uploads to any server
- ✅ **No accounts required** — No email, no password, no sign-up
- ✅ **No external databases** — Everything stays in your browser
- ✅ **Device-specific** — Data exists only on the device where you enter it

### What We Store Locally
